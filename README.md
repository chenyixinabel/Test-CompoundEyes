# Test-CompoundEyes

In the CompoundEyes project, the main program does not take video clips as input. Besides values of some parameters, four paths are most relevant to the program, which are the path to the training video set, the path to the groudtruth file of the training video set, the path to the testing video set, and the path to the groundtruth file of the testing set.

In either the training set or testing set, videos have been decomposed into frames. A video clips corresponds to a set of frames stored in a directory. All the video clips used are from the CC\_WEB\_VIDEO dataset.
