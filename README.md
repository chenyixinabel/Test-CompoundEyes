# Test-CompoundEyes

In the CompoundEyes project, the main program does not take video clips as input. Besides values of some parameters, four paths are
most relevant to the program, which are the path to the training video set, the path to the groudtruth file of the training video set,
the path to the testing video set, and the path to the groundtruth file of the testing set.
